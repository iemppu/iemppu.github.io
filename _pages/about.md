I am an Assistant Professor at the
[School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science](https://school.eecs.wsu.edu/),
[Washington State University](https://wsu.edu/),
where I lead the [ROMA Lab](/people/).
My research interests include uncertainty quantification, risk-aware robust learning and stochastic optimization for machine learning with applications to language models and computer vision.
I am the recipient of an NSF CAREER Award (2025).
Over the past four years, I taught 237 students per year on average across three courses.
I also mentor over 50 students each year in EECS as a faculty mentor.


Before joining WSU, I was a postdoctoral research associate in the
[Department of Computer Science](https://cs.uiowa.edu/)
at the [University of Iowa](https://uiowa.edu/),
under the supervision of Prof. [Tianbao Yang](https://people.tamu.edu/~tianbao-yang).

I received my Ph.D. in 2018 from the
[Centre for Artificial Intelligence (CAI)](https://www.uts.edu.au/research-and-teaching/our-research/centre-artificial-intelligence),
Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology,
[University of Technology Sydney](https://www.uts.edu.au/),
under the supervision of Prof. [Yi Yang](http://reler.net/people/yi_yang/index.html).

I spent five years with the
[ReLER Lab](http://reler.net/),
at the [University of Technology Sydney](https://www.uts.edu.au/), 
during which I also worked closely with Prof. [Ivor W. Tsang](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/cfar/about-cfar/management/prof-ivor-tsang).
I was also a visiting student at [University of Adelaide](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/),
under the supervision of Prof. [Mingkui Tan](https://tanmingkui.github.io/) and Prof. [Javen Qinfeng Shi](https://cs.adelaide.edu.au/~javen/).

In 2013, I received my B.E. in Computer Science from
[Tianjin University](https://en.tju.edu.cn/).
My undergraduate thesis was supervised by Prof. [Qinghua Hu](https://cic.tju.edu.cn/faculty/huqinghua/index.html),
and I also received extensive mentorship from Prof. [Pufeng Du](https://www.pufengdu.org/).
