title: CPTS 434/534 – Neural Network Design and Application
permalink: /teaching/cpts434/
---

## Course Overview

CPTS 434/534 introduces the foundations and practical aspects of deep neural networks, a cornerstone of modern machine learning. The course blends theoretical concepts in statistical learning with hands-on implementation of key deep learning models.


### Learning outcomes:
- Principles of representation learning and optimization
- Neural network architectures (MLPs, CNNs, RNNs, transformers)
- Practical training techniques and modern model variants

By the end of the course, students will understand how deep models are designed, trained, and applied to real-world data across vision, sequence, and structured domains.
