<h1>ROMA Lab</h1>
<p><br /> </p>
<h2>Brief Introduction</h2>
<p>ROMA (RObust MAchine learning) Lab focuses on the robustness of machine learning algorithms and their applications to computer vision.
We have particular research interests in  conformal prediction algorithms for uncertainty quantification, risk-aware learning algorithms, statistical machine learning and stochastic optimization algorithm design and analysis for machine learning problems.</p>
<h4>Conformal Prediction for Uncertainty Quantification</h4>
<p>Uncertainty quantification plays a crucial role for the robustness and trustworthiness of machine learning models. 
We engaged to developing conformal prediction algorithms for efficiently quantifying the uncertainty of machine learning models that serves as an intelligent assistant to help save human effort for decision-making.</p>
<h4>Risk-aware Learning</h4>
<p>Conventional machine learning paradigm focuses on average performance measures, but dispersion always happens no matter on data samples or predictions from the randomness of distribution.
We target on the risk-aware learning via mean-risk models such as variance regularization or conformalized objectives.</p>
<h4>Statistical Machine Learning</h4>
<p>We focus on the generalizability of the learned model via improving the learning algorithms or designing robust objectives.
Our main interest is to combine optimization process into the unified analysis for the generalization formance of the learned model, so that the overall generalization error bound can be improved.</p>
<h4>Stochastic Convex/Non-Convex Optimization for Machine Learning Problems</h4>
<p>Stochastic gradient optimization algorithms are fundamentally important for building machine learning models, not only about getting superior performance, but also understanding and controlling the behavior of learning algorithms.
We target developing stochastic optimization algorithms with theoretical analysis for a variety of machine learning problems, such as min-max, inf-projection problems, mean-risk models.</p>
<h4>Applications to Computer Vision</h4>
<p>Robustness is even increasingly important as deep learning being used in many scenarios.
We target using the cutting-edge techniques to many learning scenarios such as adversarial training, long-tail classification and object detection, where data distribution can be noisy or shifted.</p>
