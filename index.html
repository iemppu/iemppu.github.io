<h3>Brief Biography</h3>
<p>I am an Assistant Professor in Machine Learning at <a href="https://school.eecs.wsu.edu/">School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science</a>, <a href="https://wsu.edu/">Washington State University</a>, leading <a href="group.html">ROMA Lab</a> for research on uncertainty quantification, machine learning, computer vision and their applications to real-world problems.
I <a href="teaching.html">teach 240 students in three classes every year on average</a> and also <a href="https://yanyan.pro/advising.html">mentor 52 students</a> in EECS as a <a href="service.html">faculty mentor</a> every year.</p>
<p>Before joining WSU, I was a postdoctoral research associate in <a href="https://cs.uiowa.edu/">Computer Science Department</a> at <a href="https://uiowa.edu/">University of Iowa</a>, working with Professor <a href="https://people.tamu.edu/~tianbao-yang">Tianbao Yang</a>. 
I received my Ph.D. in 2018 from Centre for Artificial Intelligent (<a href="https://www.uts.edu.au/research-and-teaching/our-research/centre-artificial-intelligence">CAI</a>) in Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology (<a href="https://www.uts.edu.au/about/faculty-engineering-and-information-technology">FEIT</a>), University of Technology Sydney, Australia (<a href="https://www.uts.edu.au/">UTS</a>), under the supervision of Professor <a href="http://reler.net/people/yi_yang/index.html">Yi Yang</a>. 
I was very fortunate to spend five years with <a href="http://reler.net/people/">people</a> in <a href="http://reler.net">ReLER Lab</a>.
In 2013, I received my B.E. from <a href="http://www.tju.edu.cn/english/">Tianjin University</a>, in <a href="http://cs.tju.edu.cn/">Computer Science</a>.</p>
