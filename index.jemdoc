=== Brief Biography

I am an Assistant Professor in Machine Learning at [https://school.eecs.wsu.edu/ School of Electrical Engineering And Computer Science], [https://wsu.edu/ Washington State University], leading [group.html ROMA Lab]. 
Before joining WSU, I was a postdoctoral research associate in [https://cs.uiowa.edu/ Computer Science Department] at [https://uiowa.edu/ University of Iowa], working with Professor [https://people.tamu.edu/~tianbao-yang Tianbao Yang]. 
I received my Ph.D. in 2018 from Centre for Artificial Intelligent ([https://www.uts.edu.au/research-and-teaching/our-research/centre-artificial-intelligence CAI]) in Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology ([https://www.uts.edu.au/about/faculty-engineering-and-information-technology FEIT]), University of Technology Sydney, Australia ([https://www.uts.edu.au/ UTS]), under the supervision of Professor [http://reler.net/people/yi_yang/index.html Yi Yang]. 
I was very fortunate to spend five years with [http://reler.net/people/ people] in [http://reler.net ReLER Lab].
In 2013, I received my B.E. from [http://www.tju.edu.cn/english/ Tianjin University], in [http://cs.tju.edu.cn/ Computer Science].
